2. **Download the source project:** Download or clone the project to your computer.

3. **Open the project (Optional):** Once you have downloaded the project, extract it! You should open the project in your code editor so that you can see or understand the structure of the project.

4. **Before execute the project:**

    1. **makemigrations:** Open new terminal and inside the root directory type: `python manage.py makemigrations` to create the migrations (generate the SQL commands).
    2. **migrate:** Then run `python manage.py migrate` to run the migrations (execute the SQL commands).
    3. **Create a superuser:** To get logged into the application you have to create a superuser. Use `python manage.py createsuperuser`then complete the requested data.

5. **Execute the project:** Now you have completed the previous steps, run `python manage.py runserver` on the root directory. If everything went well, you should be able to observe a line with the following: `Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## ❗❓ Troubleshooting

-   **'NoneType' object has no attribute 'user'** To mitigate, add a simple if request is not None or similar statement. Ref: ['NoneType' object has no attribute 'user'](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23086441/nonetype-object-has-no-attribute-user)

-   **Counting items in Django templates:** Rather than passing a list of all Things and then checking their status in the template with if, you should filter your "Things" when querying them from the database. [Counting items in Django templates](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52469308/counting-items-in-django-templates)

-   **_Safe_ built-in template tag:** If you see something like this `<h1>Git</h1> <p>Git is a version...` when you try to render the content, most likely you are missing the _[safe tag](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/templates/builtins/#safe)_ when you try to render.

-   **Using static files:** If you have an error corresponding to static files. You probably want to see these links: [Django TemplateSyntaxError - 'staticfiles' is not a registered tag library](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55929472/django-templatesyntaxerror-staticfiles-is-not-a-registered-tag-library), [Django: Invalid block tag: 'static', expected 'endif'](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31117893/django-invalid-block-tag-static-expected-endif)

-   **Images Carousel:** In order to create the carousel slider on this project, you may want see [Tailwind CSS Carousel Slider Examples](https://larainfo.com/blogs/tailwind-css-carousel-slider-examples)
